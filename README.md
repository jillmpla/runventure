## üßë‚Äçüîß Troubleshooting & Common Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter when running or using **RunVenture**, along with how to fix them:

### 1. **App Won‚Äôt Start After Unzipping**:
- **Fix:** Run `npm install` inside the unzipped directory to install missing dependencies.
- Ensure you‚Äôre using Node.js v18.19.1 and npm v10.2.4 for compatibility (or newer).

### 2. **Google Maps Doesn't Load**:
- **Fix:** Make sure you've added your own Google Maps API key to a `.env` file:
  ```
  REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
  ```
- Restart the development server after updating `.env`.

### 3. **Spotify Player Not Working**:
- **Fix:** Spotify integration in this app uses the free version of the Spotify API.  
- You do not need Spotify Premium to use the player, but playback is limited to 30-second previews for some tracks unless the user is logged into a Spotify account.  
- **Note:** On iOS Safari, playback may be blocked due to Apple‚Äôs autoplay restrictions.

### 4. **No Location Access / GPS Issues**:
- **Fix:** Allow location permissions in your browser. If denied, the app uses a fallback location (University of North Carolina at Charlotte).
- In private browsing mode, some browsers block Geolocation APIs entirely.

### 5. **localStorage Not Persisting**:
- **Fix:** Avoid using Incognito/Private Browsing as some browsers clear `localStorage` automatically.
- Make sure browser settings don‚Äôt block third-party cookies or local data.

### Login (`Login.js`)
- Validates user credentials against those saved in `localStorage`.
- If the email and password match, stores the `loggedInUser` in `localStorage` and redirects to the dashboard.
- Includes a ‚ÄúForgot Password?‚Äù link that navigates to the reset form.

### Signup (`Signup.js`)
- Allows new users to register with an email and password.
- Saves user data in `localStorage` under a `users` object.
- Automatically logs in the new user by setting `loggedInUser`.

### Reset Password (`ResetPassword.js`)
- Lets users update their password if their email exists in `localStorage`.
- Displays an inline success or error message based on whether the account was found.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is designed for small-scale or local use only. Data is stored in `localStorage` and not backed by a secure backend or authentication system.

## üìä Dashboard Overview

The `Dashboard.js` page serves as the user's personalized homepage for viewing past runs, checking monthly statistics, and launching new running sessions.

### Core Features

- **Calendar View**  
  Displays the current month with clickable days. Non-run days are left blank, and the current day is highlighted.

- **List View**  
  Toggles to a history list of all runs for the selected month. Users can delete individual runs.

- **Monthly Stats**  
  Displays total **distance**, **duration**, **calories**, and **number of workouts** for the selected month.

- **Start or Plan New Run**  
  Users can either:
  - Click **START A RUN** to begin live run tracking immediately.
  - Click **+ Plan a New Run** in the calendar to use the `RouteConditions.js` planner.

- **Run Deletion Modal**  
  Users can delete specific runs via a confirmation modal. Deleted runs are removed from both `localStorage` and the visual display.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: All run data is pulled from `localStorage` using the current logged-in user's email. This ensures each user sees only their own run history and stats.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è FEATURE 1: Route Planning & Conditions ('RouteConditions.js')

The `RouteConditions.js` page allows users to **select a running route** directly on a map by tapping a starting point and destination. Once selected, the app presents a summary of route conditions.

### Features

- Interactive map for selecting start and end points
- Road-snapped walking path display
- Route difficulty scoring based on distance and elevation
- Randomly assigned tags for traffic level, surface type, and effort
- Route preview before confirming the run

### APIs Used

| API                          | Provider | Purpose                                               |
|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Geolocation API**         | Browser  | Gets the user‚Äôs current location                      |
| **Google Maps JavaScript API** | Google   | Displays the map, markers, and polylines             |
| **Google Maps Directions API** | Google   | Snaps the route to roads using walking paths         |
| **Google Maps Elevation API**  | Google   | Retrieves elevation at the midpoint of the route     |

### How Route Data is Calculated

- **Distance** is calculated using the Haversine formula, which determines the straight-line distance between two coordinates on Earth.
- **Elevation** is fetched from the Elevation API at the midpoint of the selected route.
- **Difficulty Score** is computed by combining scaled values of distance and elevation.
- **Effort (1‚Äì10)** is a normalized score derived from the difficulty.

### Confirm and Continue

Once the user confirms the route:
- The selected start/end coordinates are saved to `localStorage`.
- The user is navigated to the **Run** page to begin live tracking on the chosen route.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Surface type and traffic level are currently randomly generated for demonstration purposes. Future versions may integrate real-time data from additional APIs.

## üèÉ FEATURE 2: Live Run Tracking with Map + Music ('Run.js')

The `Run.js` page tracks your live run, visualizes your movement on a map, and plays music through Spotify during your session.

### Features

- Live GPS tracking via your device‚Äôs Geolocation
- Live duration, distance, pace, avg pace, and calorie display
- ‚ÄúHold to Finish‚Äù button to end and save your run
- Visual route mapping and markers on Google Maps
- Spotify player with playlist selection and URL loading
- Center map on current location

### APIs Used

| API                                 | Provider | Purpose                                                         |
|--------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Geolocation API**                  | W3C      | Continuously retrieves the user's live GPS coordinates          |
| **Google Maps JavaScript API**      | Google   | Renders the map, user location marker, and live run path        |
| **Google Maps Directions API**      | Google   | Displays a snapped route if a path was planned via RouteConditions |
| **Spotify Web Playback SDK / API** | Spotify  | Embeds a music player and lets users pick or load playlists     |

### How It Works

- When a user clicks **Start**, the app begins tracking time and listens for location updates.
- Each new GPS point is added to a path array, and the **distance is calculated** using the Haversine formula.
- **Calories** increase roughly every second, and **pace** is computed from the most recent distance gain.
- If a route was planned in `RouteConditions.js`, it‚Äôs retrieved from `localStorage` and drawn on the map using the **Google Directions API**, but it does not impact stats (it‚Äôs for visual reference only).
- When the user **holds down the ‚ÄúHold to Finish‚Äù button**, the run is saved, and the user is redirected to view their Post-Run stats.

### Spotify Integration

- Uses Spotify's **Web Playback SDK** to embed music playback.
- Users can:
  - Play a default playlist without logging in.
  - Load any playlist via a Spotify URL.
  - Connect their Spotify account to choose personal playlists.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Works in desktop and mobile browsers that support Geolocation and autoplay policies for audio.

## üèÅ FEATURE 3: Post-Run Summary (PostRun.js)

After a run is completed, users are automatically redirected to the **PostRun** page. This page delivers a personalized breakdown of the run‚Äôs performance and recovery tips.

### Features

- Celebratory confetti animation to mark run completion  
- Summary of the most recent run: duration, distance, pace, avg pace, calories
- Recognition of personal bests (e.g., longest run this week/month, fastest pace)
- Hydration reminders based on run duration
- Two randomized post-run recovery suggestions
- One-click (X) return to the Dashboard

### How it Works

- **All run data** is retrieved from `localStorage` under the user's email.
- The **last run** is loaded and validated (must be non-zero duration).
- Performance is evaluated by comparing this run to:
  - All runs from the past 7 days (for weekly bests)
  - All runs from the past 30 days (for duration and pace analysis)
- **Hydration reminders** are calculated using this logic:
  - Runs over 40 minutes ‚Üí at least 1 liter
  - Shorter runs get smaller water recommendations
- **Recovery tips** are selected randomly from a pool of motivational tips with icons.
